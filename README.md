# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a historical customer dataset. Customer segmentation helps businesses identify distinct groups within their customer base and allocate marketing resources more effectively.

By clustering customers based on their behaviors or demographics, businesses can target high-profit, low-risk customers for retention or tailor strategies for less profitable segments.

## Key Features
- **K-Means Clustering:** A popular machine learning algorithm used for unsupervised learning and customer segmentation.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Steps to clean and prepare the customer data for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Visual representations of the clustering results.
  
## Libraries Used
- `random`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## Results
The K-Means algorithm segments customers into groups based on their similarity. These clusters can then be analyzed to understand the characteristics of different customer segments, such as high-value customers or those at risk of churn.

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic framework for customer segmentation using K-Means. The insights gained from these clusters can help businesses make informed decisions about customer retention and marketing strategies.
